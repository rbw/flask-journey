Flask-Journey
=============

Extension to Flask that primarily helps you with blueprint management, but also (de)serialization and validation in your API routes.

It uses and is compatible with the standard Flask blueprint system, is modular and doesn't depend on anything special.

Highlights
----------

- Dead simple blueprint and route management that works with vanilla blueprints in Flask
- Drop-in replacement for ``flask.Blueprint.route`` with support for Marshmallow deserialization + validation and marshalling
